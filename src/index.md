## Interview Preparation

I'll keep documenting topics based on my understanding or from different sources I come across, where I couldn't have done better job in explaining the topic.

One of the goals of this project is to serve as a guide for refreshing my memory on designing & architecture complex systems. Sure, there are books out there, but none goes in the depth I want myself to go into, and it is fun writing your on notes. Why not?

## What's the point?

There is none, if you see none. I think these interviews are great. These challenge you into thinking how to build a system, if you were tasked to do so. Learning the fundamentals will set you up for success in your role, not only empower you to write better design documents, but also friendly challenge someone else's design as well to help bullet-proof their solution.

## How to prepare?

- Make sure you understand the fundamentals
- Stay fluent in solving some of the industry standard problems
- Think about how these concepts apply to your current/past job and where you used them or could have used them.
