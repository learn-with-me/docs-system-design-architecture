# Adding Tags

Tags help group content, esp when using search functionality. Feel free to add some on desired pages.

## How do I add a tag?

Add the tags in desired `*.md` file in the following format:

```
---
tags:
  - mkdocs
  - template
  - python
---
```

## How do I know it's working?

As an example, go [here](https://learn-with-me.github.io/mkdocs-template/). Type `mkdocs` in the search bar. You'll see the tags above show up right below document recommendation.

Similaryly, go to your website and search for the tags you added.

## Can I search the docs by tag?

Unfortunately, not at the moment. I haven't had a chance to figure that out yet. Keep an eye on updates coming to this template repository. Alternatively feel free to contribute by creating a PR for it.
